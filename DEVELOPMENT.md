# Development

Development happens in the `develop` branch, while the latest stable version is
in the `master` branch.

## Setup

The easiest way to get started on hacking on Gavel is to use [Vagrant][vagrant]
and run everything inside a virtual machine.

If you really want, you could also manually install stuff on your machine and
get Gavel running there.

Also, if you need help with anything, feel free to ask in the [Gitter
chat][gitter].

### Vagrant

Make sure you have [Vagrant][vagrant] installed on your machine.

To start the VM:

```bash
vagrant up
```

If you need to power off the VM at any point, run:

```bash
vagrant halt
```

To ssh into the VM:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

**Note: the rest of the commands in this section are meant to be run _inside
the VM_, not on the host machine.**

The project directory gets synchronized to `/gavel` inside the VM. Once you're
SSHed into the box, install Gavel's dependencies. You should only need to do
this once, unless Gavel's dependencies change:

```bash
cd /gavel
virtualenv env
source ./env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, set up Gavel. You should only need to do this once, unless Gavel's config
options change or Gavel's database schema changes:

```bash
cp config.vagrant.yaml config.yaml # set good defaults
python initialize.py
```

Finally, you're ready to run Gavel:

```bash
DEBUG=true python runserver.py
```

Now, on your local machine, you should be able to navigate to
`http://localhost:5000/` and see Gavel running! You should be able to go to
`http://localhost:5000/admin` and login with the username "admin" with the
password "admin".

If you'd like to enable sending emails, you'll also need to run a celery worker
with: 

```bash
celery -A gavel:celery worker
```

**While developing, you should keep `vagrant rsync-auto` running on the host
machine so that whenever you change any files, they're automatically synced
over to the VM.** When the app running in the VM detects changed files, it'll
automatically restart (because of the debug flag).

### Manual setup

This is not the recommended way to do things, so this section isn't super
detailed.

* Be using Python 3
* Install Postgres
* Do development inside a [virtualenv][virtualenv]
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `cp config.template.yaml config.yaml`
* Edit config file for your setup
* `python initialize.py`
* `DEBUG=true python gavel.py`

## Tips

* While developing, it's helpful to set the environment variable `DEBUG=true`

* If Gavel's database schema is changed or if the database gets messed up in
  any way, you can reset everything by running (in the Vagrant VM):

    ```bash
    sudo su postgres -c "dropdb gavel && createdb gavel"
    python initialize.py
    ```

* This project uses [EditorConfig][editorconfig].
